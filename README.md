# Microscope Simulation

The project is themed around the idea of looking through a microscope at white blood cells attacking viruses.

This project was made in Unity 2017.3.1f1

## To Run
 - Download this project as a zip onto a windows system. 
 - Go into the PreCompiledBuild folder and double click on the Unity executable named "Microscope Simulation".
 - You can use "WASD" to move the player controllable white cell and can press escape button to quit.

 
## Purpose of Project
 In the Winter/Spring of 2018, I took an interest in teaching myself graphics programming in C++ using the GLEW and GLFW libraries for OpenGL. In the process of learning graphics programming, I started to create and use simple shaders and by the end of the first series of OpenGl tutorials, I still felt a bit sketchy using shaders. So I started a small project that would require a more in-depth understanding of shaders (specifically fragment shaders).

## Why Use Unity?
 - The Unity Engine allows changes to HLSL shaders to take affect during runtime, which speeds up the iterating and debugging process. 
 - Although I had only worked with shaders in GLSL previously, there were enough similarities between GLSL and HLSL to make the process of learning HLSL not too hard.
