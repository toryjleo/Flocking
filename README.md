 ## Purpose of Project
 In the Winter/Spring of 2018, I took an interest in teaching myself graphics programming in C++ using the GLEW and GLFW libraries for OpenGL. In the process of learning graphics programming, I started to create and use simple shaders and by the end of the first series of OpenGl tutorials, I still felt a bit sketchy using shaders. So I started a small project that would require a more in-depth understanding of shaders (specifically fragment shaders).
